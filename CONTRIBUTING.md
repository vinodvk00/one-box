### Pull Requests

6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Process

### Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
3. Set up your environment variables
4. Start the development servers

### Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages using conventional commits
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### Commit Messages

We use conventional commits. Format: `type(scope): description`

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Write integration tests for new API endpoints
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
